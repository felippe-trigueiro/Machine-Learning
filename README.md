# Machine-Learning
This repository is divided into two groups: The exercises and a project regarding the Machine Learning Course which was taken at UNICAMP in 2019 and some Machine Learning algorithms together with som usefuls functions that I implemented from scratch.

The algorithms used in the exercises are:

1 - Regression problem: Linear Regression with Ridge Regularization. In this project I built all the features from scratch.  
2 - Binary and Multiclass Classification Problem: Logistic Regression and KNN. In this project I built all the features from scratch.
3 - Binary Classification: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this project I used the SCIKITLEARN Package.

The Project consisted in Computer Vision problem which I tried to use Convolutional Neural Networks in a problem called Image Registration, that consists in findind the geometric transformation which alligns two images according to an specific measure. For implementind the project I used the KERAS Package.

Until this moment, the algorithms implemented from scratch are:

1 - Logistic Regression with no regularization and Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithm;

The functions implemented corresponds to some metrics used in classification problems, such as True Positive Rate and F1 Score.
